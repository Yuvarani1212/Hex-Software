TASK-1
1)PROJECT1-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 Dataset

Project Overview:

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the COVID-19 public dataset.

Using Microsoft Excel, we clean, visualize, and analyze the data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Components:

Dataset File: The raw COVID-19 data is provided in [Covid19_Dataset.xlsx]. 

This file contains daily statistics, including cases, deaths, and recoveries, collected from public sources.

Cleaned Data File: The file [Covid19_Cleaned_Data.xlsx] contains the cleaned dataset where missing values have been handled and data formats standardized for consistent analysis.

Visualizations File: The [Covid19_Visualizations.xlsx] file includes various charts and graphs such as time series plots, 

bar charts, and heatmaps that illustrate the trends and distributions in the COVID-19 data.

Analysis Report: The [Covid19_Analysis_Report.xlsx] provides a summary of the analysis, including key findings, statistical summaries, and insights drawn from the data.

Tools Used:

Microsoft Excel: The primary tool for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. 

Excel’s features like PivotTables, charts, and built-in functions were utilized extensively.

Excel Functions: Key functions include SUM, AVERAGE, MEDIAN, STDEV, and CORREL, used for performing statistical calculations and data transformations.

Charts and PivotTables: Created to visualize data trends, relationships, and summaries. 

Charts include time series plots for cases over time, bar charts for comparisons, and heatmaps for geographic data analysis.

Getting Started:

Download the Files: Retrieve the dataset and analysis files from this repository.

Open in Excel: Use Microsoft Excel to open the .xlsx files.

Explore the Analysis:

Review the cleaned dataset.

Examine the visualizations in datas  to understand trends and patterns.

Read the summary and insights in the data folder

Contributions:

Contributions to this project are welcome. Please fork the repository, make enhancements, and submit pull requests to improve the analysis.

2)PROJECT2-Simple Linear Regression on Housing Prices

Simple Linear Regression on Housing Prices

Project Overview:

This project focuses on predicting housing prices using Simple Linear Regression.

The analysis is performed using Microsoft Excel, where we apply regression techniques to understand the relationship between housing features and prices.

Components:

Dataset File: [Housing_Prices_Dataset.xlsx] - Contains the raw data for housing prices.

This dataset includes features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and other relevant attributes.

Cleaned Data File: [Housing_Prices_Cleaned_Data.xlsx] - Features the dataset after preprocessing. Missing values have been handled, and data has been standardized for accurate analysis.

Regression Analysis File: [Housing_Prices_Regression_Analysis.xlsx] - Contains the regression analysis results. Includes the regression model, coefficients, and evaluation metrics.

Visualizations File: [Housing_Prices_Visualizations.xlsx] - Includes charts and graphs to visualize the relationship between housing features and prices, such as scatter plots and trend lines.

Tools Used:

Microsoft Excel: Used for data cleaning, applying regression analysis, and visualizing results. 

Key features include built-in regression tools and charting capabilities.

Excel Functions and Tools:

Regression Analysis: Utilized Excel’s Data Analysis Toolpak for running regression models.

Functions: Applied functions like LINEST for regression statistics and FORECAST for predictions.

Charts: Created scatter plots with trend lines to visualize the regression results.

Getting Started

Download the Files: Access the dataset and analysis files from this repository.

Open in Excel:

Open the [Housing_Prices_Dataset.xlsx] file to view the raw data.

Review the cleaned dataset in [Housing_Prices_Cleaned_Data.xlsx].

Examine the regression analysis and results in [Housing_Prices_Regression_Analysis.xlsx].

Explore visualizations in [Housing_Prices_Visualizations.xlsx] to understand the data trends and predictions.

Run the Analysis:

Use the Data Analysis Toolpak in Excel to perform Simple Linear Regression on the cleaned data.

Review the output for regression coefficients and goodness-of-fit metrics.
