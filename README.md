Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 Dataset

Project Overview:

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the COVID-19 public dataset.

Using Microsoft Excel, we clean, visualize, and analyze the data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Components:

Dataset File: The raw COVID-19 data is provided in [Covid19_Dataset.xlsx]. 

This file contains daily statistics, including cases, deaths, and recoveries, collected from public sources.

Cleaned Data File: The file [Covid19_Cleaned_Data.xlsx] contains the cleaned dataset where missing values have been handled and data formats standardized for consistent analysis.

Visualizations File: The [Covid19_Visualizations.xlsx] file includes various charts and graphs such as time series plots, 

bar charts, and heatmaps that illustrate the trends and distributions in the COVID-19 data.

Analysis Report: The [Covid19_Analysis_Report.xlsx] provides a summary of the analysis, including key findings, statistical summaries, and insights drawn from the data.

Tools Used:

Microsoft Excel: The primary tool for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. 

Excelâ€™s features like PivotTables, charts, and built-in functions were utilized extensively.

Excel Functions: Key functions include SUM, AVERAGE, MEDIAN, STDEV, and CORREL, used for performing statistical calculations and data transformations.

Charts and PivotTables: Created to visualize data trends, relationships, and summaries. 

Charts include time series plots for cases over time, bar charts for comparisons, and heatmaps for geographic data analysis.

Getting Started:

Download the Files: Retrieve the dataset and analysis files from this repository.

Open in Excel: Use Microsoft Excel to open the .xlsx files.
