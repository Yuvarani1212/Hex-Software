Model Building: Train a logistic regression model to predict loan eligibility.

Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

Data Visualization: Generate plots to visualize the distribution of variables, model predictions, and the relationships between different features.

Dataset Description:

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

Loan_ID: Unique identifier for each applicant (dropped before model training).

Gender: Applicant's gender (Male/Female).

Married: Marital status of the applicant (Yes/No).

Dependents: Number of dependents.

Education: Applicant's education level (Graduate/Not Graduate).

Self_Employed: Self-employment status (Yes/No).

ApplicantIncome: Applicant's income.

CoapplicantIncome: Coapplicant's income.

LoanAmount: Amount of loan applied for.

Loan_Amount_Term: Term of the loan in months.

Credit_History: Credit history of the applicant (1 = Good, 0 = Bad).

Property_Area: Type of area the applicant resides in (Urban/Rural/Semiurban).

Loan_Status: Target variable indicating whether the loan was approved (1 = Approved, 0 = Not Approved).

Prerequisites:

Ensure that the following Python libraries are installed:

pandas

seaborn

matplotlib

scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using:

bash

pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn

Code Explanation:

Data Creation and Loading:

A sample dataset is created to simulate real-world loan application data. The dataset is then loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

Data Preprocessing:

The Loan_ID column is dropped as it is not necessary for model training.

Categorical columns are encoded into numeric values using LabelEncoder.

Missing values in the LoanAmount column are handled by filling them with the mean loan amount.

Model Training:

The dataset is split into features (X) and target (y), with X including all relevant columns except Loan_Status.

The data is further split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

A Logistic Regression model is trained on the training set.

Model Evaluation:

The model's accuracy is calculated on the test set.

A confusion matrix is plotted to visualize the model's performance.

Classification metrics are displayed to give a detailed performance report.

Data Visualization:

Various plots are generated to visualize the distribution of loan amounts, the count of loan status approvals, and the relationship between applicant income and loan status.

Running the Project

To run the project, simply execute the Python script in your preferred IDE or terminal. The script will:

Load and preprocess the dataset.

Train a Logistic Regression model to predict loan eligibility.

Display various plots and model evaluation metrics to assess performance.

Sample Output

Confusion Matrix: A heatmap that shows the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives of the model predictions.

Loan Amount Distribution: A histogram representing the distribution of loan amounts in the dataset.

Loan Status Count: A bar chart showing the count of approved versus not approved loans.

Applicant Income vs. Loan Status: A bar plot showing the average applicant income for each loan status category.

Conclusion:

This project provides a comprehensive example of building a machine learning model to predict loan eligibility, complete with data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. 

It serves as an excellent 

starting point for anyone interested in learning how to apply data science techniques to real-world problems.

Bar plot for top 10 countries by total confirmed cases:

A bar chart is generated to display the top 10 countries based on the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases.

Calculate Case Fatality Rate (CFR):

The Case Fatality Rate is calculated for each country using the formula:

CFR = (TotalDeaths / TotalConfirmed) * 100

Bar plot for top 10 countries by CFR:

A bar chart is generated to visualize the top 10 countries with the highest Case Fatality Rate.
